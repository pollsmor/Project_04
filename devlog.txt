- Design doc (beta)
  - Basic idea down
  - Separation of minimum viable product and nice to have features

- Design doc v1.0
  - Roles assigned
  - Component map/available features
  - Backend to frontend data mechanism diagram

- Two column layout for legend for better use of space
  - (and to fit everything on one screen on a 13-inch laptop)
- Ability to change amount of days shown on the X-axis on demand

  - Dedicated min and max buttons so the user doesn't spend 30 seconds going from
    one extreme to the other
  - Tooltip explaining how to use the feature
- Fixed an error in the dataset
- Use CSS on classes for colors rather than use style attribute
- Hover over a line to:
  - Highlight it
  - Highlight the text of the respective epidemic in the legend

- Let's use the full width of the page rather than arbitrary number
- Throw in a title while we're at it
