- Design doc (beta)
  - Basic idea down
  - Separation of minimum viable product and nice to have features
  - Still need to do: roles of each group member, component map, why Bootstrap or Foundation, data from backend to frontend diagram

- Design doc v1.0
  - Roles assigned
  - Component map/available features
  - Backend to frontend data mechanism diagram
  - Bootstrap vs. Foundation reasoning
- README updated to bring in line with ddoc v1.0, launch codes (shamelessly copypasted from previous project)
