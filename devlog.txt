- Design doc (beta)
  - Basic idea down

  - Update default days to 300
  - Emphasize the fact that COVID-19 requires edge cases
  - The X-axis doesn't require additional math for scaling

- Introductory section for webpage

kevinL -- 2020-05-09 14:30
- Implementing a vertical line down the graph necessitates a few changes.
  - Hovering over a line itself no longer does anything.
