          Our webpage compares various epidemics from recent years. It compares
          them day by day from the beginning of each. The X-axis shows the number
          of elapsed days and the Y-axis shows the total amount of deaths caused by each.

          A lot of inciteful data can be deciphered from our graph; for example,
          one can easily see how COVID-19 took the world by storm, while the MERS
          epidemic is slothful enough to make you question whether it should even
          be classified as one.
